						The website is designed to show my inclination towards fun, cute, and simple designs. This website was coded from scratch without using bootstrap or any frameworks. It may sound abit stupid but I did it with the intention of solidifying my HTML and CSS foundation since it has been some time since I last used them. There's still lots that I need to improve on though!

						Overbuying groceries is a common problem in many households, and we identified that this problem arises when families do not know how to estimate the family's overall consumption. These extra food stays in the fridge or on the shelves, turns bad, and gets discarded.<br>
						In this 24 hour hackathon, my team and I hence decided to build a smart trash bin which sorts out food waste from the other waste, and provides the family's food waste statistics on a dashboard. To identify the waste, using a Raspberry Pi, our smart bin takes a photo of the waste products, and uses Good Cloud Vision API to obtain some keywords based on the image captured. We then filter out the keywords to identify the object being discarded.<br>
						The dashboard also allows users to input details of their family members(such as their age, weight, height) so that we can calculate their recommended calorie intake, and provide better suggestions for the family to plan their grocery shopping.

						The Handroid is a robotic arm that mimics that of a human's. It aims to aid elderly in their daily tasks and can be controlled wirelessly by a remote control which translates the elderly's actions into instructions for the robotic arm's movement. Our users are then able to use our robotic arm to perform tasks that are too physically tedious for them, such as tasks that involve carrying heavy objects.<br>
						A project website was also put together as part of our promotional effort, and also to document our progress.

						An IOS application built for Orbital (CP2106 Independent Software Development Project) which spans across the summer break.<br>
						Ever encountered the situation "Buy 5 for the price of 3" and but you only have 2 items that you are interested in purchasing?<br>
						O'amigo targets shoppers who wants to enjoy the discounted prices without hitting the quota  themselves, by matching them with someone to share the deal with!<br>
						Application layout and all icons used are designed and coded by me. Product is still at its prototype stage as progress was hindered by the multiple committee positions I took up during the last summer break. May consider to pick it up again when I have the time to!

						<b>Team members:</b> Caryn, Jeremy, Vanessa, Natania<br><br>
						Being newbies to telegram chat bots, we decided to make use of this chance to learn how to build one.<br>
						We got inspiration from our dear friend Francis, who is a fairly annoying person but does not like the use of uncouth language. Hence, we created a Telegram bot as an attempt to replicate his behaviour. Yes, you guessed it, it's an annoying Telegram bot which actually reminds you to mind your language, and at the same time randomly remind you of the number of days to finals! (and more annoying features haha)
